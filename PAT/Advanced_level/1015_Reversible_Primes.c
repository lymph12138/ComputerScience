/*
A reversible prime in any number system is a prime whose "reverse" in that number system is also a prime.
For example in the decimal system 73 is a reversible prime because its reverse 37 is also a prime.
Now given any two positive integers N (<10^5) and D (1<Dâ‰¤10), 
you are supposed to tell if N is a reversible prime with radix D.
Input Specification:
The input file consists of several test cases. Each case occupies a line which contains two integers N and D. 
The input is finished by a negative N.
Output Specification:
For each test case, print in one line Yes if N is a reversible prime with radix D, or No if not.
Sample Input:
73 10
23 2
23 10
-2
Sample Output:
Yes
Yes
No
