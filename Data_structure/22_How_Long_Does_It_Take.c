/*
Given the relations of all the activities of a project, you are supposed to find 
the earliest completion time of the project.
Input Specification:
Each input file contains one test case. Each case starts with a line containing two positive integers N (≤100), 
the number of activity check points (hence it is assumed that the check points are numbered from 0 to N−1), 
and M, the number of activities. Then M lines follow, each gives the description of an activity. 
For the i-th activity, three non-negative numbers are given: S[i], E[i], and L[i],
where S[i] is the index of the starting check point, E[i] of the ending check point, 
and L[i] the lasting time of the activity. The numbers in a line are separated by a space.
Output Specification:
For each test case, if the scheduling is possible, print in a line its earliest completion time; 
or simply output "Impossible".
